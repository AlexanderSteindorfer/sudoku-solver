# Sudoku Solver
A naive backtracking algorithm to solve a Sudoku.
<br/><br/>

### Short explanation
This Sudoku Solver uses a naive backtracking algorithm to check a Sudoku board for empty fields and what number could be placed in it according to the Sudoku rules. It will continue placing numbers in the board (thereby mutating the input board) until there are no more empty spaces, or the puzzle is not solvable.
<br/><br/>

### How to use

Open **sudoku_solver.py** and run the code to see the example given. You may place a differnt Sudoku puzzle there by entering the numbers manually.

### What I learned

Combination of recursion and backtracking in a simple way.
